# K-Length-Paths-for-Graphs-in-Assembly

The project, written in Assembly x86 AT&T syntax, consists of 2 tasks: creating the adjancency matrix based of the adjancency lists for a graph and determining the number of k-length paths between two nodes in the graph. The project has 2 versions: one with static memory allocation and one with dynamic memory allocation.

## Input:

1) Number of Task (1 for matrix, 2 for paths)
2) Number of nodes
3) Number of edges for each node
4) Edges for each node in order
5) Length of the path, starting node, destination (only for second task)
